# Arduino Lights

Haskell-to-C compiler for Arduino, and software simulator in Haskell. Lets you write your own light displays as relatively simple Haskell data structures, without having to e.g. know anything about monads.

## Usage

You'll want to add your own patterns in `src/Patterns.hs`. Reading the types in `src/Types.hs` is a good start, or you can just copy from the example patterns in `Patterns.hs`.

By default, `make run` will run the software simulator. If your terminal supports color output via escape sequences, you should be able to see the lights in approximately the same color as they'd appear on actual hardware.

To switch from simulation to running on actual hardware, you'll need an Arduino device. `make setup` on a mac installs the Arduino CLI, finds the connected board, and connects. Swap which line is commented out in `main`, and then `make run` to run the compiler.

To see the actual C code which was generated by the compiler, look at `ArduinoLights.ino`
